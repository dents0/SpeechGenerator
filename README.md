Speech Generator
================

**Author:** Deniss Tsokarev

Description
-----------
A speech generator written in Python. 
The script generates a speech of the desired length and saves it to a .docx file. 

People say approximately 5 sentences per minute, however, as the speech gets longer, the amount of sentences per minute will decrease. 

The less length is chosen the less repetitive the speech will look.

Requirements
------------
* Python 3.6+
* [python-docx module](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

How to use
----------
1) Run the file **speech_generator.py**.
2) Enter desired **length** of speech, a **heading** and **name** the file that will store the result.

3) The file with generated speech will be created in the same directory where **speech_generator.py** is.
